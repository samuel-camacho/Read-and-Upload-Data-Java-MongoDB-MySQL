Project for Universitiy - Discipline: Distributed Information Systems 

Project and Discipline Score: 17 (0-20). 

The goal was to read and get the information from a light and temperature sensors.  

The data was uploaded to a MongoDB Database and then transfered to a mySQL database.  

The ultimate goal was to use the data in the mySQL database to build graphs of evolution in a Android mobile application (which we did), so that the user could evaluate the results.
